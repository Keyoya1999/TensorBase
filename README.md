# NNClasses
This repo contains two classes to facilitate convolutional models in python with TF.
NNModels.py contains the Models class which should serve as a parent class for other tensorflow models.
NNLayers.py contains the Layers class which should serve as a parent class for connected networks in tensorflow. This class should be instantiated within a child instance of NNModels.py
